# GuesserGame
 
GuesserGame is a small project that I am working on and the goal is to push what the limits are to making a simple number guessing game.
The basic rules for the game are:
 - Pick a number between the MIN and MAX
 - If the anwswer is correct, add 10 points
 - For each wrong guess, remove 1 point from the granted points
 - Repeat for 10 rounds
 - The max score is 100 points
 - And the minimum is 0
