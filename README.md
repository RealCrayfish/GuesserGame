# GuesserGame
GuesserGame is a small project that I am working on where I try to see how far I can take a simple number guessing game.

The basic concept is a player has to try to guess a number between a minimum and a maximum and has to repeat this 10 times. Each correct guess will give 10 points but if you guess wrong, it will deduct a point from your score. The maximum score is 100 points.
