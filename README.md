# GuesserGame
GuesserGame is a project that I am working on where my goal is to make a simple number guessing game and push it to the limits of my ability.
There are a few different versions of the game including CLI Python and CLI C++ versions.

## Builds
For versions that require compiling, I will only compile for Windows however if you wish to compile for your own machine feel free to do so.

## Contributing
You may create forks of this project for your own use however I will not accept contributions to this project. This is because the goal of this project is to push it to the limits **my** ability.

## License
I don't really care about what you do with the code since this is just a personal "practice" project that I am not too bothered about so feel free to do whatever you want with it. However I would prefer if you didn't distribute it under your name. But please link this repository if you do decide to distribute it.
